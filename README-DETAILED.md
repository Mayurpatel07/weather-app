## How is it built?

### Two Main Parts:

   - Built with React.js
   - Beautiful animations using Framer Motion
   - Charts for temperature data using Chart.js
   - Interactive maps using Leaflet
   - Toast notifications for feedback

2. **Backend** (behind the scenes)
   - Built with Express.js
   - Connects to OpenWeatherMap API
   - Protects your API key
   - Adds security with rate limiting
   - Handles all API requests

## How to Run the App

### What You Need Before Starting
- Node.js installed on your computer
- NPM (comes with Node.js)
- An OpenWeatherMap API key (free to get from their website)

### Step 1: Install Everything
Open a terminal/command prompt and run:
```
cd "path-to-your-project-folder"
npm run install-all
```
This installs all the necessary packages for both frontend and backend.

### Step 2: Set Up Your API Key
Create or edit the `.env` file in the `server` folder with:
```
API_KEY=your_openweathermap_api_key
PORT=5000
```
Replace `your_openweathermap_api_key` with your actual API key.

### Step 3: Start the Application
Run this command to start both the frontend and backend:
```
npm run dev
```

### Step 4: Open the App
Open your web browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:3000
```

## Other Useful Commands
